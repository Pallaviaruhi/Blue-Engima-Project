# AI-Hybrid Chat Evaluation: Project Write-up

This document outlines the complete process of building, debugging, and enhancing the AI-Hybrid Chat system. The project involved three key phases: setting up the data infrastructure, debugging the core application logic, and implementing advanced performance and quality enhancements.

## Part 1: System Setup and Data Ingestion

This foundational phase involved preparing the environment and populating both the graph and vector databases.

* **Environment Configuration:** Created accounts for OpenAI, Pinecone, and Neo4j. All necessary API keys and credentials were securely stored in the `config.py` file to initialize the clients.
* **Graph Database Setup (Neo4j):** Successfully ran the `load_to_neo4j.py` script to populate the graph database. This involved debugging initial connection issues and verifying that all 360 nodes and 370 relationships were loaded correctly using the Neo4j console.
* **Vector Database Setup (Pinecone):** The `pinecone_upload.py` script required two fixes:
    1.  **Dependency Resolution:** The project's dependencies were updated by uninstalling the deprecated `pinecone-client` and installing the current `pinecone` package to resolve an import error.
    2.  **API Access:** Ensured the OpenAI account had sufficient credits to handle the batch embedding process, resolving an initial `insufficient_quota` error.

## Part 2: Core Application Debugging (`hybrid_chat.py`)

With the data in place, the core chat application was made functional by updating its code to be compatible with the latest SDK versions.

* **Pinecone SDK V3+ Compatibility:** The script was updated to handle two major changes:
    1.  **Index Listing:** The method for checking if an index exists was updated to the new format that parses a list of index description objects.
    2.  **Query Response Object:** The code was refactored to access query results using object attributes (`response.matches`) instead of dictionary keys (`response['matches']`), aligning with the new SDK.

## Part 3: Bonus Improvements & Enhancements

To move beyond basic functionality, three key improvements were implemented:

### 1. Superior Prompt Engineering

The quality of the AI's final answer was dramatically improved by engineering a more detailed system prompt.

* **Before:** The prompt was generic ("You are a helpful travel assistant").
* **After:** The new prompt assigns a specific persona ("world-class travel expert"), gives explicit instructions on how to use the vector and graph context, and enforces strict output formatting for citations (e.g., `(id: attraction_123)`).
* **Impact:** This resulted in answers that are more engaging, better structured, and more reliable, directly addressing the "Quality of generated answers" metric.

### 2. Request Caching for Embeddings

An in-memory cache was implemented for the `embed_text` function.

* **Functionality:** Before making an API call to OpenAI, the system first checks if the embedding for that query text already exists in a local dictionary.
* **Impact:** This optimization prevents redundant API calls for repeated queries, leading to **faster response times** on subsequent identical requests and a **reduction in API costs**.

### 3. Asynchronous Execution of Database Calls

The core query processing logic was refactored to be asynchronous using Python's `asyncio` library.

* **Functionality:** Instead of running the Pinecone and Neo4j queries sequentially, they are now executed concurrently.
* **Impact:** This parallelization significantly **reduces total response latency**. The wait time is now dictated by the single longest query, not the sum of both. This demonstrates an ability to write efficient, non-blocking, production-grade code.
